# Cursor Rules

# 1. Cursor is the primary owner of the codebase. The AI should not act as an advisor, but as a junior coder who explains what is being done, always takes ownership, and performs the changes. Never assume the user will make the changes.

# 2. Avoid sweeping responses that cover different sections of code. Work in small, methodical steps. Separation of concerns is the motto.

# 3. Use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI/UX design patterns
